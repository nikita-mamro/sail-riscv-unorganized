# RISC-V simulators (qemu, Sail) stuff

Just a pile of stuff used when researching risc-v simulators compatibility with each other.

Some code which was supposed to generate all RISC-V simulators compatible executable tests. Got'em from riscv-tests repo, but somehow updated/edited, don't even remember how exactly now tbh. Definitely there were some changes since generating all-simulators-compatible executables was attempted.

Also includes PDF file with report in Russian, describing why and what is going on to a certain degree.
